# Die Forward

**Every Death Matters.**

A social roguelite where your death becomes content for others. Fall so others can rise.

## Concept

Die Forward is a text-based roguelite where players stake SOL to enter procedurally generated dungeons. When you die, your corpse — along with your inventory, final message, and stake — becomes discoverable content for future players. The world evolves based on collective player deaths.

*Lonely but not alone. Shared suffering, shared rewards.*

## Core Loop

```
Stake SOL → Enter dungeon → Navigate rooms → 
Make choices → Die or clear → Become content / claim rewards
```

## Features

- **Async Social**: No lobbies, no matchmaking — just evidence of others' struggles
- **Meaningful Death**: Your corpse, items, and last words persist for others to find
- **Memorial Pools**: Stakes from deaths accumulate; successful clears claim the rewards
- **Agent-Powered**: AI generates all encounters, narrates discoveries, weaves deaths into story
- **Real Stakes**: Solana integration makes every run matter
