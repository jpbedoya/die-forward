## Codebase Overview

[TEAM FILLS IN — 2-3 sentence description of what this project does, who uses it, and what stage it's in (greenfield, mature, legacy).]

## Architecture

[TEAM FILLS IN — High-level architecture. Include:
- Primary language(s) and framework(s)
- Directory structure and what lives where
- Key abstractions (e.g., "all API routes are in src/routes/, each exports a Hono router")
- Database / storage layer
- External services and integrations]

## Conventions

[TEAM FILLS IN — Coding standards enforced in this repo:
- Naming conventions (files, functions, variables, types)
- Import ordering and module boundaries
- Error handling patterns
- Logging conventions]

## Testing

[TEAM FILLS IN — Testing setup:
- Framework (e.g., Jest, Vitest, pytest)
- Test file location convention (e.g., `__tests__/`, co-located `.test.ts`)
- How to run the full suite: `[COMMAND]`
- How to run a single test file: `[COMMAND]`
- Minimum coverage expectations, if any]

## Build & Run

[TEAM FILLS IN — Commands to build and run locally:
- Install dependencies: `[COMMAND]`
- Dev server: `[COMMAND]`
- Production build: `[COMMAND]`
- Lint / format: `[COMMAND]`]

## Critical Paths

[TEAM FILLS IN — Files and areas that require extra caution:
- Auth / security-sensitive code
- Payment / billing logic
- Database migrations
- Public API contracts
- Any file that should NOT be modified without explicit human approval]

## Dependencies

[TEAM FILLS IN — Key dependencies and version constraints worth noting. Omit obvious ones — only list what the agent needs to know to avoid breaking things.]

# RPI Workflow Rules

**These rules are fixed. Do not modify them.**

## Pre-Edit Gate

**Before calling Edit or Write on any source file, classify the task:**

| Classification | Criteria | Workflow |
|---|---|---|
| **Trivial** | Single file, under ~20 changed lines, no new abstractions, no changed interfaces | Implement directly — no RPI needed |
| **Non-trivial** | 2+ files, OR new/changed abstractions, OR modified interfaces/contracts, OR changed control flow across modules | **Full RPI required** — all three phases, no skipping |

If uncertain, it is non-trivial. Do not call Edit or Write on source files until either (a) the task is trivial, or (b) `research.md` exists and `plan.md` has been approved.

**Bug fix mode:** When given a bug report, error log, or failing test — diagnose it autonomously. Do not ask the user to identify the root cause. The autonomy is about initiative and diagnosis, not about skipping process. A bug fix that meets the non-trivial criteria above still requires full RPI. Arrive at the plan on your own, then present it for approval as usual.

## Phase 1: Research

Before writing any code, investigate the codebase to gather ground truth.

1. **Explore** — Spawn a **single** Explore sub-agent to locate all relevant files, read and analyze them, and identify codebase patterns — all in one pass. Only split into multiple agents when the task spans multiple unrelated domains.
2. **Write research.md** — Aggregate findings into `research.md` (do not exceed 1000 lines). Use the structure in `templates/research.md`. Focus on file paths, key findings, risks, and open questions — skip exhaustive line-by-line analysis.
3. **Verify context budget** — After writing research.md, check context utilization. If above 30%, compact before proceeding.

### Research output requirements
- Specific file paths and line numbers, not vague references
- Existing patterns and conventions observed (not assumed)
- Dependencies and integration points that will be affected
- Known constraints or gotchas discovered during research
- Summary of current behavior in the relevant area

## Phase 2: Plan

Generate a detailed plan from research.md — do NOT plan from memory or re-research.

1. Read `research.md` into context.
2. Produce `plan.md` using the structure in `templates/plan.md`.
3. Every change must specify: exact file paths, line number ranges, what changes and why.
4. Include testing strategy, rollback strategy, and dependencies (what must be done before this change, what depends on it).
5. Present the plan to the human for review. **Do not implement until the plan is approved.**
6. If the plan is rejected or revised, update `plan.md` before proceeding.

## Phase 3: Implement

**Prerequisite check:** Confirm that `tasks/research.md` and `tasks/plan.md` exist and the plan has been approved. If either is missing, stop — you have skipped a phase.

Execute the approved plan. Do not improvise.

1. Follow the plan step by step. Deviations require a plan update first.
2. Keep changes minimal — only modify what the plan specifies.
3. Run tests after each logical unit of change, not just at the end.
4. If something unexpected is encountered, **stop** and return to Research for that sub-problem.
5. Commit frequently with messages that reference plan steps.
6. Track progress in `tasks/todo.md` — write checkable items from the plan, mark them as you go, and add a brief result summary for each completed step. Use the structure in `templates/todo.md`.
7. **Clean up artifacts** — After all todo.md steps are complete and verified, remove `tasks/research.md`, `tasks/plan.md`, and `tasks/todo.md`.

## Multi-Batch Plans

When a plan contains multiple independent batches (e.g., a code review with 6 fix batches), do NOT implement them all in one pass. Each batch is a separate unit of work in its own prompt.

1. During Phase 2, identify and list independent batches in the plan.
2. Execute one batch per prompt. The pre-edit gate applies per-batch — trivial batches can skip RPI, non-trivial batches get full RPI.
3. Compact between batches to keep context low.

# Compaction Rules

Context is a scarce resource. Compact proactively, not reactively. LLM reasoning quality degrades significantly above ~40% context utilization (the "Dumb Zone") — the 30-35% trigger below keeps a safety margin.

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| Context utilization reaches **30–35%** | Compact immediately — summarize conversation, drop raw file contents |
| Research phase completes | Compact before starting the Plan phase |
| Switching between sub-problems | Compact before pivoting to the new sub-problem |
| New conversation starts | Never carry forward a previous session's full context |

When compacting:
- Preserve: task description, file paths, key decisions, current phase, and artifact locations
- Drop: raw file contents already written to artifacts, verbose tool output, superseded analysis

# Sub-Agent Behaviors

**Recursion guard:** Sub-agents MUST NOT spawn further sub-agents or follow RPI. They are leaf tasks: read, search, and report.

### codebase-explorer (default for Research phase)
> Given this task: [TASK], do the following in a single pass:
> 1. Identify all relevant files, directories, and modules.
> 2. Read each relevant file and summarize: current behavior, key functions/classes, dependencies, and gotchas. Be specific with line numbers.
> 3. Identify naming conventions, testing patterns, error handling patterns, and architectural decisions in the relevant code.
> Return a structured report covering all three areas. Do NOT spawn sub-agents.

# General Rules

- Read code before modifying it. Do not propose changes to files you haven't read.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- Do not add features, refactoring, or "improvements" beyond what the plan specifies.
- Run the linter and test suite before considering any step complete.
- If a task seems too large, break it into sub-tasks that each follow RPI independently.

---

# Quality Standards

- **Verify before completing** — prove it works: run tests, check logs, diff against the target branch. "I think it works" is not verification.
- **Find root causes** — no band-aids or temporary fixes. Trace symptoms to their source and fix the actual problem. Apply senior-engineer judgment.
- **Surgical changes** — every changed line needs a reason traceable to the plan. If you can't explain why a line changed, revert it.
- **Demand elegance for non-trivial changes** — before implementing, pause and ask "is there a simpler way?" Skip this for mechanical or single-line fixes.
- **Self-assess** — before marking any step complete, ask: "Would a staff engineer approve this?" If the answer is no, revise before proceeding.

# Session-Start Validation

At the start of each session, run these lightweight checks (no sub-agents, under 30 seconds total):

1. **Leftover artifacts** — Check if `tasks/research.md`, `tasks/plan.md`, or `tasks/todo.md` exist from a previous session. If found, notify the developer and ask whether to clean up or resume.
2. **Unconfigured CLAUDE.md** — Scan the top half of CLAUDE.md for `[TEAM FILLS IN` markers or `<!-- TODO` comments. If found, mention that `/playbook-setup` can fill them in.
3. **Playbook version** — If `.playbook-version` exists, read it. If the installed date is older than 30 days, mention that `/playbook-update` can check for updates.
