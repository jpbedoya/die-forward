## Changes

### Step 1: [Short description of change]

**Files:**
- `path/to/file.ts` (L42–L78) — [What changes and why]
- `path/to/other.ts` (L10–L15) — [What changes and why]

**Tests:**
- [ ] [Test to add or update, with file path]

**Verification:**
- [ ] [How to confirm this step worked — e.g., "run `npm test -- file.test.ts`"]

### Step 2: [Short description of change]

**Files:**
- `path/to/file.ts` (L100–L120) — [What changes and why]

**Tests:**
- [ ] [Test to add or update, with file path]

**Verification:**
- [ ] [How to confirm this step worked]

[Continue for each step. Keep steps small enough to verify independently.]

## Testing Strategy

**New tests:**
- [List of new test cases to write, with file paths]

**Modified tests:**

## Dependencies

[What must be completed before this change can be made? What other systems or tasks depend on this change?
