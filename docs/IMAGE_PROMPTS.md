# Die Forward — Image Generation Prompts

All prompts are optimized for **DALL·E (ChatGPT)**. Use 1024×1024 for square assets, 1792×1024 for wide/banner assets.

---

## ⚠️ Shared Style Block

Every asset uses this same visual language (now already baked into the prompts below):

> Style: hyper-detailed dark fantasy digital painting, photorealistic, cinematic. Pure black background. Single dramatic amber/gold light source (torchlight) — strong contrast, deep shadows. Color palette: near-black, deep charcoal, amber gold, bone white, blood-rust red accents. Atmospheric fog, subtle glow. No bright colors, no neon, no cartoon style, no gradients. Ultra detailed, 1024x1024.

This style is confirmed from two generated assets: the dagger icon (blade plunging into water, amber ripple glow) and the Twitter banner (adventurer, skull sigil, HP/ST bars). All new assets should match these.
