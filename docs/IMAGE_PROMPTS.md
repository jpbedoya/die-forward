# Die Forward — Image Generation Prompts

All prompts are optimized for **DALL·E (ChatGPT)**. Use 1024×1024 for square assets, 1792×1024 for wide/banner assets.

---

## ⚠️ Shared Style Block

Every asset uses this same visual language. **Paste this at the end of every prompt** to lock the style:

> Style: hyper-detailed dark fantasy digital painting, photorealistic, cinematic. Pure black background. Single dramatic amber/gold light source (torchlight) — strong contrast, deep shadows. Color palette: near-black, deep charcoal, amber gold, bone white, blood-rust red accents. Atmospheric fog, subtle glow. No bright colors, no neon, no cartoon style, no gradients. Ultra detailed, 1024x1024.

This style is confirmed from two generated assets: the dagger icon (blade plunging into water, amber ripple glow) and the Twitter banner (adventurer, skull sigil, HP/ST bars). All new assets should match these.

## 1. App Icon

**Usage:** Android launcher + iOS App Store. Square. 512×512 master.

---

### Variant A — Blade (original v1)

Mobile game icon. A downward-pointing rusted blade plunging into black still water, creating a single ripple. Pale bone white handle against pure black background. Amber light catching the rust on the blade. Minimal, bold, iconic. Dark souls aesthetic meets ancient flooded temple. No text. Square format, strong silhouette, readable at small sizes. Matte painterly finish.

---

### Variant B — Skull (current, live in app)

Epic mobile game app icon for a dark roguelite. Central image: a weathered skull half-submerged in perfectly still black water, a flickering amber torch flame reflected on the surface, ancient flooded stone stairs descending into darkness behind it. Color palette: deep black, abyssal dark blue, pale bone white, sickly muted green, amber gold. Style: dark gothic, hand-painted texture, painterly but readable at small sizes. Dramatic low-angle lighting, single strong light source (the torch). Atmosphere of cold ancient dread — patient, not aggressive. No text. Square composition, centered subject, bold silhouette that reads clearly at 64x64px. Ultra detailed, cinematic, 1024x1024.

---

## 2. Twitter / X Banner

**Usage:** Twitter/X profile header. 1792×1024 output (DALL·E wide), will be cropped to 1500×500. Keep lower-left corner clear — profile avatar overlaps there.

---

### Prompt

```
Wide cinematic banner for a dark roguelite mobile game called "Die Forward." A lone adventurer seen from behind, descending ancient flooded stone stairs into a vast underground crypt corridor. Torch held aloft, amber light reflecting off the perfectly still black water below. Stone archways receding into total darkness ahead. Title text "DIE FORWARD" etched in weathered monospace lettering into the stone on the left side of the image — as if carved. Subtle skull motif and crypt runes flanking the title. Atmosphere: ominous, lonely, ancient. No modern elements. No faces. No bright colors. Style: hyper-detailed dark fantasy digital painting, photorealistic, cinematic. Pure black background. Single dramatic amber/gold light source (torchlight) — strong contrast, deep shadows. Color palette: near-black, deep charcoal, amber gold, bone white, blood-rust red accents. Atmospheric fog, subtle glow. No bright colors, no neon, no cartoon style, no gradients. Ultra detailed, 1024x1024.

## 3. Marketing Page — Hero Background

**Usage:** `dieforward.com` fullscreen hero section. Must sit behind white/amber text — should be dark and not compete. 1792×1024.

---

### Prompt

```
Fullscreen background painting for a dark roguelite website. A vast flooded underground crypt chamber viewed in one-point perspective — stone archways receding deep into darkness, shallow black water covering the floor reflecting distant amber torchlight.

Very dark overall — most of the image is near-black with a single amber glow at the center horizon. No text, no characters with faces. Horizontal composition, heavy vignette around all edges. Style: hyper-detailed dark fantasy digital painting, photorealistic, cinematic. Pure black background. Single dramatic amber/gold light source (torchlight) — strong contrast, deep shadows. Color palette: near-black, deep charcoal, amber gold, bone white, blood-rust red accents. Atmospheric fog, subtle glow. No bright colors, no neon, no cartoon style, no gradients. Ultra detailed, 1024x1024.
