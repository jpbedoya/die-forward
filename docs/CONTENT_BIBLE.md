# Die Forward — Content Bible

## Core Concept
A text-based roguelite where death is not the end — it's content. When you die, your corpse, inventory, and final words become part of the world for future players to discover.

---

## Setting: The Eternal Descent

The world exists above a vast underworld — not hell, not heaven, but something older. A place that existed before the gods named it. Mortals who seek fortune descend into its depths, staking their souls (and SOL) for a chance at glory.

**The truth no one speaks:** The underworld *wants* visitors. It feeds on their memories, their final words, their despair. Every death makes it stronger. Every corpse becomes part of its architecture.

---

## Tone & Voice

### Writing Style
- **Second person, present tense** — "You descend. The air grows cold."
- **Sparse, evocative** — Short sentences. Fragments welcome.
- **Sensory-first** — Describe what you feel, hear, smell before what you see
- **Dread through understatement** — Horror implied, not explicit

### Vocabulary Bank

**Use freely:**
- Ancient, forgotten, nameless, hollow, pale
- Descend, sink, drift, seep, crawl
- Whisper, murmur, echo, silence
- Stone, water, shadow, bone, ash
- Cold, damp, still, heavy, wrong

**Avoid:**
- Modern words (computer, digital, cyber)
- Clichés (suddenly, very, really)
- Excessive adjectives
- Exclamation marks

### Sample Tone
> The stairs end. Below, water stretches into darkness — black and still as glass. Something moves beneath the surface. Something patient.

---

## The Hackathon Zone: THRESHOLD OF THE UNNAMED

The first descent. A place between the world above and the true depths below. Ancient stairs carved by forgotten hands lead down into flooded halls where the boundary between life and death grows thin.

### Zone Identity
- **Element:** Water and stone
- **Color palette:** Black, deep blue, pale bone-white, sickly green
- **Sounds:** Dripping water, distant echoes, wet footsteps, silence
- **Smell:** Brine, rot, wet stone, copper
- **Temperature:** Cold. Always cold.

### Zone Lore
This was once a temple — or a tomb. The distinction no longer matters. Water seeped in centuries ago, and with it came things that should not exist. The walls remember prayers in dead languages. The water remembers everyone who drowned.

---

## Room Types

### EXPLORE
Traversal rooms. Atmosphere and choice.
- Describe the environment
- Build tension
- Offer meaningful choices (different paths, risk/reward)

### COMBAT
Encounter hostile entities.
- Describe the creature before the fight
- Convey threat through behavior, not stats
- Make enemy "intent" feel organic, not gamey

### CORPSE
Discover fallen players.
- Somber, respectful tone
- The corpse is a real person who failed
- Their final words should feel heavy

### CACHE
Rest and resupply.
- Brief moment of safety
- Describe relief, but tinged with unease
- Nothing is truly safe here

### EXIT
Escape to victory.
- Earned triumph
- Light after darkness
- But hint that you'll return...

## Bestiary

### Tier 1 — Common Horrors

Encountered frequently. Individually manageable, but draining over time.

#### The Drowned
Once human. Now waterlogged husks animated by the underworld's hunger. They move wrong — joints bending backward, mouths open in silent screams.

**Behavior:** AGGRESSIVE (lunging), DEFENSIVE (circling), ERRATIC (twitching)

> It rises from the water. Bloated. Pale. Its eyes are gone but it sees you anyway.

#### Pale Crawlers
Things that skitter in the dark. Too many limbs. They cling to walls and ceilings, dropping when you pass beneath. Were they ever human? You can't tell anymore.

**Behavior:** STALKING (following from shadows), AMBUSH (dropping from above), SWARMING (they're never alone)

> You hear it before you see it — wet clicks on stone. Then another. Then more.

#### The Hollow
Empty shells. No face, no features — just the outline of a person carved from shadow. They mimic your movements a half-second late.

**Behavior:** MIRRORING (copying your stance), ADVANCING (slow, inevitable), REACHING (arms too long)

> It stands where you stood a moment ago. Facing where you faced. It has no eyes but you feel it watching.

#### Bloated Ones
Corpses swollen with dark water. They burst when struck, releasing something worse — a cloud of choking memory, visions of how they died.

**Behavior:** SHAMBLING (slow approach), RUPTURING (explosive death), LEAKING (trail of corruption)

> The body blocks the passage. Distended. Taut. Something moves beneath its skin.

---

### Tier 2 — Uncommon Threats

Dangerous encounters. Require strategy or resource expenditure.

#### Hollow Clergy
The priests who once tended this place. They still perform their rituals, but the god they serve has no name. Their prayers are static. Their blessings are curses.

**Behavior:** CHANTING (building power), CONDEMNING (cursing), BECKONING (don't approach)

> It kneels before an altar of black stone, speaking words that hurt to hear.

#### The Bound
Souls that refused to pass on, now wrapped in chains of their own regret. They drag their burdens through the halls, seeking others to share the weight.

**Behavior:** PURSUING (relentless), BINDING (grasping chains), PLEADING (asking for help)

> Chains rattle in the dark. Something whispers your name. How does it know your name?

#### Forgotten Guardians
Stone sentinels animated by old magic. They protected something once — a tomb, a treasure, a secret. They no longer remember what, but they remember *how*.

**Behavior:** DORMANT (statue-still until triggered), AWAKENING (slow, grinding), RELENTLESS (feels no pain)

> You thought it was a statue. Then it turned its head.

#### The Weeping
Spirits of grief given form. They drift, wailing silently, and their touch brings sorrow so deep it wounds the body.

**Behavior:** DRIFTING (floating aimlessly), MOURNING (drawn to pain), EMBRACING (cold, draining touch)

> Tears run down a face with no eyes. It reaches for you like a lost child.

---

### Tier 3 — Rare Terrors / Bosses

Major encounters. Zone-defining threats.

#### The Unnamed
You cannot see it clearly. Your mind refuses. It exists in the corner of your vision, in the space between thoughts. It has always been here. It will always be here.

**Behavior:** WATCHING (unmoving attention), REACHING (reality bends), SPEAKING (not in words)

> Something is here. You can't see it. You can't describe it. But you know. You *know*.

#### The Throne Keeper
It sits where no throne exists, in a hall you can't remember entering. It was a king once, or a god. Now it is just *waiting*. It has been waiting for you specifically. It knew you would come.

**Behavior:** JUDGING (weighing your worth), COMMANDING (compelling obedience), RISING (when judgment is passed)

> "Approach." You don't want to. Your legs move anyway.

#### The Memory
Not a creature — an event. A moment that keeps happening. You see yourself dying, over and over, in ways that haven't happened yet. Is it a warning? A threat? A promise?

**Behavior:** SHOWING (visions of death), LOOPING (time stutters), BECOMING (it starts to look like you)

> You see yourself fall. You see yourself drown. You see yourself standing exactly where you stand now. The other you waves.

---

### Creature Design Principles

1. **Imply, don't explain** — What *was* it? Players should wonder.
2. **Movement matters** — How they move tells their story.
3. **Sound defines presence** — You hear them before you see them.
4. **Behavior over stats** — "It's circling" is scarier than "10 damage."
5. **Death isn't victory** — Killing them should feel necessary, not triumphant.

---

## Items

### Torch
> A flickering flame. It pushes back the dark, but the dark pushes back.

### Herbs
> Bitter leaves that numb pain and slow bleeding. They taste like regret.

### Bone Charm
> Carved from something's finger. It hums when danger is near. It never stops humming.

### Rusted Blade
> Pitted with age and old blood. Still sharp enough.

### Pale Coin
> Currency of the dead. Worth nothing above. Worth everything below.

### Drowned Scripture
> Waterlogged pages in a language you almost understand. Reading it feels like remembering something you never knew.

---

## Death & Corpses

### Finding a Corpse

When discovering another player's body, convey:
- They were real. They tried.
- What remains is just an echo
- Their final words carry weight

**Sample discoveries:**
> A body against the wall. Still fresh. Their hand clutches something — a note? A prayer? Their final words are scratched into the stone beside them.

> You almost step on them. Half-submerged. Face down. How long have they been here? The water keeps no record.

### Dying

Death should feel:
- Inevitable but earned
- Somber, not punishing
- Like the end of a story, not a failure

**Sample death moments:**
> The cold reaches your chest. Your legs stop working. The water rises, or maybe you sink. It's hard to tell the difference now.

> You fall. The stone is cold against your cheek. Somewhere above, light flickers. You won't reach it.

### Final Words

Players write their own, but the surrounding text should frame it:
> Your last thought crystallizes. Something for those who follow. A warning? A joke? A prayer?

---

## Audio Direction

The soundscape is as important as the words. Audio should feel **ancient, wet, and wrong** — like being somewhere you shouldn't be.

---

### Philosophy

- **Less is more** — Silence builds tension. Don't fill every moment.
- **Diegetic first** — Sounds that exist in the world (drips, echoes) over "soundtrack"
- **Unease over shock** — No jump scares. Slow creeping dread.
- **Water is ever-present** — It's the zone's element. You should always sense it.

---

### Ambient Layers

**Base layer (constant, low):**
- Slow, irregular water drips — never rhythmic, unpredictable
- Deep room tone — cavernous emptiness, almost subsonic
- Distant echoes — unclear source, could be footsteps, could be nothing

**Mid layer (occasional):**
- Water movement — something displaced it. What?
- Stone settling — groans, cracks, the place is old
- Wind from nowhere — there shouldn't be wind down here

**Unsettling layer (rare, triggered):**
- Whispers at edge of hearing — not words, just the shape of voices
- Breathing that isn't yours — or is it?
- A sound that stops exactly when you notice it

---

### Music

**Style:** Dark ambient / drone
- **Instruments:** Low strings, bowed metal, waterphone, processed voices
- **No melody** — Texture and atmosphere only
- **Key:** Minor, but often atonal or microtonal
- **Tempo:** None. Timeless.

**Layers by game state:**

| State | Music Feel |
|-------|-----------|
| Exploring | Near-silence, occasional deep tones, room tone |
| Approaching combat | Low drone builds, dissonance creeps in |
| In combat | Rhythmic pulse (heartbeat), tension, still minimal |
| Victory | Drone fades, brief moment of silence, then resolution tone |
| Death | Music drops out. Just water. Then nothing. |
| Finding corpse | Single sustained note, mournful, fades slowly |

**Reference artists:**
- Lustmord (dark ambient)
- Atrium Carceri (dungeon atmosphere)
- Ben Frost (tension, dread)
- Akira Yamaoka (Silent Hill — emotional horror)

---

### Sound Effects

**Movement:**
- Footsteps on wet stone — squelch, echo, weight
- Wading through water — resistance, cold implied
- Climbing/scrambling — scraping, effort

**Combat:**
- Player attacks — thuds, impacts, bone cracking (not slashing)
- Enemy attacks — wet sounds, grasping, unnatural movement
- Damage taken — gasp, stumble, visceral but not gory
- Dodge — water splash, quick movement, relief
- Brace — held breath, impact absorbed
- Healing — liquid, bitter swallow, exhale

**Environment:**
- Doors/passages — stone grinding, ancient mechanisms
- Discovering items — small chime, but muted (not "video gamey")
- Discovering corpse — silence falls, then a single tone

**UI (minimal):**
- Menu select — soft stone tap
- Confirm — deeper tap
- Error/invalid — dull, blocked sound (not harsh)
- Text appearing — subtle, like water drops (or nothing)

---

### Creature Audio

**The Drowned:**
- Movement: Wet dragging, joints popping wrong
- Idle: Gurgling, water in lungs, almost-moaning
- Attack: Sudden splash, grasping, desperate
- Death: Collapse into water, bubbling, then still

**Hollow Clergy:**
- Movement: Robes dragging on wet stone
- Idle: Chanting — monotone, language unknown, unsettling rhythm
- Attack: Chant peaks, discordant, painful to hear
- Death: Chant cuts off mid-word. Silence.

**The Unnamed:**
- Movement: You don't hear it move. It's just... closer.
- Presence: Static, pressure, your own heartbeat loud
- Attack: Reality distortion — sounds stretch, reverse, layer
- "Death": Sound returns to normal. Was it ever there?

---

### Room-Specific Audio

**EXPLORE rooms:**
- Full ambient layers
- Music minimal, almost absent
- Emphasize isolation

**COMBAT rooms:**
- Ambient pulls back
- Music tension builds
- Creature sounds dominate

**CORPSE rooms:**
- Ambient softens
- Single mournful tone
- Respectful silence for reading final words

**CACHE rooms:**
- Brief safety — ambient lightens slightly
- Almost warm (but not quite)
- Don't let them relax fully

**EXIT room:**
- Distant light sound? Wind from above?
- Music resolves (rare moment of harmony)
- Ambient fades as you ascend

---

### Technical Notes

- **Format:** .mp3 for music, .wav for SFX (or .ogg for web)
- **Looping:** Ambient layers should loop seamlessly
- **Ducking:** Music should duck under SFX, especially combat
- **Randomization:** Multiple variants for common sounds (footsteps, drips)
- **Silence:** Literal silence is a tool. Use it at death, corpse discovery.

## Content Generation Guidelines

When generating room descriptions, combat narration, or death text:

1. **Stay in second person, present tense**
2. **Keep it under 50 words for room descriptions**
3. **Lead with sensation, not sight**
4. **End on tension or unease**
5. **Never break the fourth wall**
6. **Vary sentence length — short punchy mixed with longer flow**
7. **The underworld is patient, not aggressive**

---

## Sample Room Sequence (Hackathon Zone)

1. **EXPLORE** — The descent begins. Stairs into darkness.
2. **EXPLORE** — Flooded corridor. Water rises.
3. **COMBAT** — The Drowned emerge.
4. **CORPSE** — Find a fallen player.
5. **CACHE** — Alcove above waterline. Brief rest.
6. **COMBAT** — Hollow Clergy blocks the path.
7. **EXPLORE** — The threshold. Almost through.
8. **COMBAT** — The Unnamed notices you.
9. **EXIT** — Light. Escape. For now.
