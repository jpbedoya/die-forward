# Die Forward — Content Bible

## Core Concept
A text-based roguelite where death is not the end — it's content. When you die, your corpse, inventory, and final words become part of the world for future players to discover.

---

## Setting: The Eternal Descent

The world exists above a vast underworld — not hell, not heaven, but something older. A place that existed before the gods named it. Mortals who seek fortune descend into its depths, staking their souls (and SOL) for a chance at glory.

**The truth no one speaks:** The underworld *wants* visitors. It feeds on their memories, their final words, their despair. Every death makes it stronger. Every corpse becomes part of its architecture.

## Tone & Voice

### Writing Style
- **Second person, present tense** — "You descend. The air grows cold."
- **Sparse, evocative** — Short sentences. Fragments welcome.
- **Sensory-first** — Describe what you feel, hear, smell before what you see
- **Dread through understatement** — Horror implied, not explicit

### Vocabulary Bank

**Use freely:**
- Ancient, forgotten, nameless, hollow, pale
- Descend, sink, drift, seep, crawl
- Whisper, murmur, echo, silence
- Stone, water, shadow, bone, ash
- Cold, damp, still, heavy, wrong

**Avoid:**
- Modern words (computer, digital, cyber)
- Clichés (suddenly, very, really)
- Excessive adjectives
- Exclamation marks

### Sample Tone
> The stairs end. Below, water stretches into darkness — black and still as glass. Something moves beneath the surface. Something patient.

---

## The Hackathon Zone: THRESHOLD OF THE UNNAMED

The first descent. A place between the world above and the true depths below. Ancient stairs carved by forgotten hands lead down into flooded halls where the boundary between life and death grows thin.

### Zone Identity
- **Element:** Water and stone
- **Color palette:** Black, deep blue, pale bone-white, sickly green
- **Sounds:** Dripping water, distant echoes, wet footsteps, silence
- **Smell:** Brine, rot, wet stone, copper
- **Temperature:** Cold. Always cold.

### Zone Lore
This was once a temple — or a tomb. The distinction no longer matters. Water seeped in centuries ago, and with it came things that should not exist. The walls remember prayers in dead languages. The water remembers everyone who drowned.

## Room Types

### EXPLORE
Traversal rooms. Atmosphere and choice.
- Describe the environment
- Build tension
- Offer meaningful choices (different paths, risk/reward)

### COMBAT
Encounter hostile entities.
- Describe the creature before the fight
- Convey threat through behavior, not stats
- Make enemy "intent" feel organic, not gamey

### CORPSE
Discover fallen players.
- Somber, respectful tone
- The corpse is a real person who failed
- Their final words should feel heavy

### CACHE
Rest and resupply.
- Brief moment of safety
- Describe relief, but tinged with unease
- Nothing is truly safe here

### EXIT
Escape to victory.
- Earned triumph
- Light after darkness
- But hint that you'll return...

## Bestiary

### The Drowned
**Tier 1 — Common**

Once human. Now waterlogged husks animated by the underworld's hunger. They move wrong — joints bending backward, mouths open in silent screams.

**Behavior patterns:**
- AGGRESSIVE — Lunging, grasping, hungry
- DEFENSIVE — Circling, watching, waiting for weakness
- ERRATIC — Twitching, unpredictable, broken

**Sample descriptions:**
> It rises from the water. Bloated. Pale. Its eyes are gone but it sees you anyway.

> The shape was human once. Now it moves like a puppet with tangled strings.

### The Hollow Clergy
**Tier 2 — Uncommon**

The priests who once tended this place. They still perform their rituals, but the god they serve has no name. Their prayers are static. Their blessings are curses.

**Behavior patterns:**
- CHANTING — Building power, preparing something terrible
- CONDEMNING — Pointing, judging, cursing
- BECKONING — Inviting you closer. Don't.

### The Unnamed
**Tier 3 — Rare/Boss**

You cannot see it clearly. Your mind refuses. It exists in the corner of your vision, in the space between thoughts. It has always been here. It will always be here.

**Behavior patterns:**
- WATCHING — Unmoving. Waiting. You feel its attention.
- REACHING — Reality bends. Distance lies.
- SPEAKING — Not in words. In certainty. In dread.

## Items

### Torch
> A flickering flame. It pushes back the dark, but the dark pushes back.

### Herbs
> Bitter leaves that numb pain and slow bleeding. They taste like regret.

### Bone Charm
> Carved from something's finger. It hums when danger is near. It never stops humming.

### Rusted Blade
> Pitted with age and old blood. Still sharp enough.

### Pale Coin
> Currency of the dead. Worth nothing above. Worth everything below.

### Drowned Scripture
> Waterlogged pages in a language you almost understand. Reading it feels like remembering something you never knew.

## Death & Corpses

### Finding a Corpse

When discovering another player's body, convey:
- They were real. They tried.
- What remains is just an echo
- Their final words carry weight

**Sample discoveries:**
> A body against the wall. Still fresh. Their hand clutches something — a note? A prayer? Their final words are scratched into the stone beside them.

> You almost step on them. Half-submerged. Face down. How long have they been here? The water keeps no record.

### Dying

Death should feel:
- Inevitable but earned
- Somber, not punishing
- Like the end of a story, not a failure

**Sample death moments:**
> The cold reaches your chest. Your legs stop working. The water rises, or maybe you sink. It's hard to tell the difference now.

> You fall. The stone is cold against your cheek. Somewhere above, light flickers. You won't reach it.

### Final Words

Players write their own, but the surrounding text should frame it:
> Your last thought crystallizes. Something for those who follow. A warning? A joke? A prayer?

## Audio Direction (for implementation)

### Ambient
- Constant: Slow dripping water, distant echoes
- Occasional: Stone grinding, water movement, whispers at edge of hearing

### Music
- Minimal, drone-based
- Low frequencies, unsettling harmonics
- Silence is also a tool

### SFX
- Footsteps on wet stone
- Water disturbed
- Combat: Impact sounds, not slashing (thuds, cracks)
- UI: Subtle, stone-like clicks

## Content Generation Guidelines

When generating room descriptions, combat narration, or death text:

1. **Stay in second person, present tense**
2. **Keep it under 50 words for room descriptions**
3. **Lead with sensation, not sight**
4. **End on tension or unease**
5. **Never break the fourth wall**
6. **Vary sentence length — short punchy mixed with longer flow**
7. **The underworld is patient, not aggressive**

5. **CACHE** — Alcove above waterline. Brief rest.
