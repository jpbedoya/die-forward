# Die Forward — Auth Plan

## Implementation Status (Feb 2026)

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Phase 1: Backend auth endpoints | ✅ Done | All 3 routes live (`/auth/wallet`, `/auth/guest`, `/auth/link-wallet`) |
| Phase 2: Frontend auth flow | ✅ Done | Wallet + guest both get real InstantDB tokens |
| Phase 3: Player records | ✅ Done | `players` table with `authId`, `authType` |
| Phase 4: Nickname flow | ✅ Done | DB-wins for wallet, local-first for guest, 🪦 edit UI |
| Phase 5: InstantDB permissions | ✅ Done | Perms written + enforceable now that tokens are real |
| Phase 6: Account linking | ✅ Done | LinkWalletModal + merge logic in backend |

### One remaining item

| Item | Status | Blocker |
|------|--------|---------|
| Wallet signature verification | ⏳ Waiting | `signMessage` not exposed by `@wallet-ui/react-native-web3js`. Backend nacl verification is already implemented and `SKIP_VERIFICATION` backdoor exists as placeholder. Remove it when MWA adapter adds `signMessage`. |

## Current Auth Architecture

### Identity Model

```
WALLET USER                          GUEST USER
──────────────────────────────       ──────────────────────────────
authId  = wallet address             authId  = UUID (stored locally)
authType = 'wallet'                  authType = 'guest'
walletAddress = address              walletAddress = undefined
nickname ← DB is source of truth     nickname ← AsyncStorage is source of truth
```

### Source of Truth Rules (critical)

| State | Nickname source | Local cache |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| Wallet auth | **InstantDB DB always wins** | Write-through cache only |
| Guest auth | AsyncStorage | IS the source |

**Why DB wins for wallet users:** The wallet address is stable across devices and sessions. The DB is the canonical store. Local cache is just for fast reads — it is always populated FROM the DB, never pushed TO the DB on sync.

### Disconnect = Full Logout

Calling `game.disconnect()` clears:
- All auth state (`isAuthenticated`, `authId`, `authType`)
- Local nickname cache (`AsyncStorage`)
- Prompted flag
- Guest progress flag
- Resets to `initialState`

---

## Auth Flows

### Wallet Flow

```
1. User taps "BIND WALLET"
   → wallet.connect() → walletAddress set
   → useEffect auto-authenticates (sets isAuthenticated: true, authId = walletAddress)
   → syncNickname useEffect fires
   → getOrCreatePlayerByAuth(authId, 'wallet')
   → DB nickname loaded, overwrites local cache
   → If default name (new user): show NicknameModal

2. User sets nickname via 🪦 NAME ✎ tap
   → Opens NicknameModal (pre-filled)
   → On confirm: write to DB first, then update local cache + state

3. User taps [logout]
   → Full reset: auth state + local storage cleared
```

### Guest Flow

```
1. User taps "EMPTY-HANDED"
   → signInAsGuest() → new UUID authId
   → syncNickname reads AsyncStorage first
   → If no local name: show NicknameModal
   → Guest player record created in DB

2. User sets nickname
   → Saved to AsyncStorage only (not DB-authoritative for guests)

3. No explicit logout needed (ephemeral session)
```

### Wallet Bind After Guest Session

```
Guest playing → taps "BIND WALLET" in The Toll
→ wallet.connect() runs
→ auto-auth fires → authType switches to 'wallet'
→ syncNickname fetches DB for this wallet address
→ DB record wins — local guest name is NOT carried over
→ If new wallet (no DB record): nickname prompt shown
→ If existing wallet: their DB name restored
```

**Design decision:** DB always wins when wallet auth is present. Guest names are ephemeral.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mobile/lib/GameContext.tsx` | Auth state machine, syncNickname, disconnect |
| `mobile/lib/auth.ts` | signInWithWallet, signInAsGuest, linkWalletToGuest helpers |
| `mobile/lib/instant.ts` | getOrCreatePlayerByAuth, updatePlayerNicknameByAuth |
| `mobile/app/stake.tsx` | Wallet connect UI, identity row (🪦), NicknameModal trigger |
| `mobile/components/NicknameModal.tsx` | Name entry modal (first-time + editing, initialValue prop) |
| `mobile/components/LinkWalletModal.tsx` | Guest → wallet linking UI |

---

## Simplified Auth (Current Implementation)

The planned signature verification (Phase 1) is not yet live. Current auth is:

```
Wallet: authId = walletAddress (no signature verification)
Guest:  authId = UUID stored in AsyncStorage via signInAsGuest()
```

This is sufficient for the current stage — ownership is implied by wallet address, not cryptographically proven. Full signature verification is a post-hackathon hardening task.

---

## syncNickname — Stale Async Protection

`syncNickname` runs in a `useEffect` and awaits DB calls. A `cancelled` flag prevents stale responses from writing state after logout:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  let cancelled = false;
  const syncNickname = async () => {
    const result = await getOrCreatePlayerByAuth(...);
    if (cancelled) return; // ignore if logged out while awaiting
    updateState({ nickname: result.player.nickname });
  };
  syncNickname();
  return () => { cancelled = true; };
}, [state.isAuthenticated, state.authId, ...]);
```

## Player Stats & Leaderboard

### Stats Tracking
Deaths and victories update player stats server-side via `authId` lookup (not `walletAddress`). This supports both wallet and guest players correctly.

- **Death** → increments `totalDeaths`, updates `highestRoom`, `totalLost`
- **Victory** (session `status: 'completed'`) → increments `totalClears`, updates `totalEarned`, `highestRoom`
- Session stores `authId` at creation time so server routes can always find the right player record

### Leaderboard Rules
Players appear in RANKS if:
- `highestRoom > 0` (has played)
- Nickname is not `"Wanderer"` (default guest name)
- Nickname doesn't match wallet-address format (`AB12...XY78`)

### getOrCreatePlayerByAuth Safeguards (added Feb 2026)
1. **Wallet fallback:** If authId lookup returns no result, falls back to lookup by `walletAddress` — prevents duplicate records when authId was stored differently
2. **AuthId drift correction:** If a wallet user's record has a non-wallet authId (e.g. a guest ID from a bad migration), it is auto-corrected to the wallet address on next login
3. **Guest ID protection:** A guest ID can never overwrite a wallet user's `authId`

## Remaining Work

### Wallet Signature Verification
**Status:** Waiting on external dependency

The backend already has full nacl verification implemented in `src/app/api/auth/wallet/route.ts`. When the MWA wallet adapter exposes `signMessage`, the flow is:

1. Remove `SKIP_VERIFICATION` check from the backend route
2. Pass a real `signMessage` function into `signInWithWallet()` in `auth.ts`
3. Done — no other changes needed

**How to detect when unblocked:** Check `@wallet-ui/react-native-web3js` release notes for `signMessage` / `signBytes` support.

### Email Claiming (Future)
Allow guest users to claim their account with an email address (magic link flow) to persist across device reinstalls. Not planned for current release.

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Wallet user sign-in (simplified, no signature)
- [x] DB nickname loads on wallet connect (auto-auth useEffect)
- [x] Empty-handed user gets unique guest ID
- [x] Nickname prompt for new wallet users (default name check)
- [x] Nickname prompt for new guests (no local name)
- [x] Nickname edits write to DB (wallet) or local (guest)
- [x] Disconnect = full logout, clears all state
- [x] Stale syncNickname cancelled on logout
- [x] Guest session → wallet bind → DB name wins
- [x] Deaths use nickname (not wallet address)
- [x] Wallet auth hits backend + gets real InstantDB token
- [x] Guest re-auth uses existingGuestId — returning guests keep same identity
- [x] disconnect() calls signOut() → clears InstantDB session + all local storage
- [x] InstantDB perms enforced (players self-only update, deaths immutable)
- [ ] Wallet signature verification — waiting on MWA signMessage support
- [ ] Email claiming — future
